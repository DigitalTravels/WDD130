    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose for this website is to create a community for like minded people and make a safespace for gamers. We
      want our group to function as a support structure. While some people will have their differences, the idea is that
      we would be able to come together whenever needed. In this sense, the website would also function as a social
      media site. On top of helping us talk to each other, we would be able to schedule meetups and other events with
      it.</p> <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience would be anyone who wants to play games, relax, and have fun. We want to create a good atmosphere
      that will foster this feeling of fun and camaraderie. Since we stand outside of the corporate world, we would be
      able to reshape things to our liking.</p> <!-- change this -->

      Content
    </h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>Hello and welcome to The Wasteland Trauma. Being here means that one has taken the first steps in joining our
      community. Right now, we are a small-knit group of people who play games, chat, and generally try to work with
      each other in whatever gaming endeavor we are embarking on. In the future, we are hoping to be able to set up
      larger-scale meetups and events that everyone can enjoy. The best part of us running a website is that we are not
      run by a corporation that steals people's data or advertises in order to make a quick buck. On top of this, we
      understand that notifications are annoying. With this in mind, and after we actually add the ability to receive
      notifications, they will be something one will have to enable. Also, if being a part of our merry band of brothers
      and sisters is not something that sounds appealing, one simply just has to close their account on our website and
      all their personal data will disappear from our drives. We have no quotas to meet, so that negates the need to
      keep people here any longer than they desire.
    </p>
    <p>As one can clearly see, we strive to create as stress free an environment as possible. In such a chaotic
      environment as the world is today, we want to create an environment that is conducive of mental health. With this
      in mind, the user interface will be as simple as possible. This will prevent any potential confusion. We will also
      maintain a set of rules that will help keep things from getting too out of hand while also keeping a modicum of
      freedom. To that effect, we will need to compare the code of conduct used by similar sites to get an idea of what
      we might incorporate. In the end though, this code of conduct will have to be updated as the site progresses. As
      we evolve, so should the policies we use.

    <h3>Social Media</h3>
    <p>
      On the social media side of things, things will definitely be a little more work at first. We will likely start
      with only having categories and threads, but that is due to the simplicity of their setup. As time goes on, we
      might work on the structure little by little. The main purpose of our social media (at least at first) will simply
      be to have an area we can call our own. In this area, we will have significantly less pressure since our posts
      will be capable of editing if there are any mistakes and the delete button will not be hidden. While there will be
      a prompt to prevent accidental deletions, that will be the only guard. No one will have to be held to something
      they are embarrassed by when they are older.

    <h3>Calander</h3>
    <p>
      Given that we want to be able to have fun group events, we will be incorporating a calendar into the website. This
      means that anyone who is looking to participate will be able to see ahead of time. On top of this, it will be
      possible to set up notifications, but that will have to be set up later on due to the difficulty coding it would
      initially take too long because it would likely involve concepts I am yet unfamiliar with. On top of showing
      events like tournaments, the calendar would also list group IRL meetups. Since everyone is scattered across the
      states, planning these meetups will take time, effort, and money. However, it is something that we would be able
      to iron out with time. In instances where some members are closer than others, we would even be able to have mini
      meetups.
