    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose for this website is to create a community for like minded people and make a safespace for gamers. We want our group to function as a support structure. While some people will have their differences, the idea is that we would be able to come together whenever needed. In this sense, the website would also function as a social media site. On top of helping us talk to each other, we would be able to schedule meetups and other events with it.</p> <!-- change this -->

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our audience would be anyone who wants to play games, relax, and have fun. We want to create a good atmosphere that will foster this feeling of fun and camaraderie. Since we stand outside of the corporate world, we would be able to reshape things to our liking.</p> <!-- change this -->
